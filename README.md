# Rotate Car With Android Accelerometer
 This is a simple Unity project for a car controller script that allows the player to control a car's movement in the forward direction and tilt it using the device's accelerometer. The script uses Unity's Rigidbody component to simulate realistic physics for the car.

> [!NOTE]
> * Ensure the Rigidbody component is attached to the car GameObject.
> * This script is designed for mobile devices or platforms that support accelerometer input.
> * Feel free to modify and enhance the script to suit your specific project requirements. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
